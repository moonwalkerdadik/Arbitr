Arbitration Platform
Project Description
Arbitration Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Base blockchain. It provides a secure and transparent way for users to conduct peer-to-peer transactions using escrow smart contracts. If disputes arise, the platform employs a decentralized arbitration mechanism where trusted arbitrators vote to resolve the issue. This eliminates the need for a central authority, providing users with confidence in the fairness of the process.

Features
Escrow Transactions: Users can lock funds in a smart contract until both parties agree that the terms of the deal have been met.
Dispute Resolution: In the event of a dispute, a panel of arbitrators is selected to review the case and vote on the outcome.
Decentralized Arbitration: Arbitrators are chosen from a pool of registered users, and their votes determine the resolution.
Reputation System: Arbitrators are incentivized to act fairly through a reputation system based on their performance in resolving disputes.
Problem Solved
The Arbitration Platform solves the problem of trust in decentralized peer-to-peer transactions. By utilizing a decentralized arbitration process, users can be sure that their funds are secure and that disputes will be resolved in a transparent and fair manner. This eliminates the risks of fraud and non-compliance, which are common in many blockchain transactions without a reliable dispute resolution system.

Technologies Used
Solidity: For writing smart contracts on the Base blockchain.
React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
Node.js & Express: Backend server for handling off-chain logic and API routes.
Web3.js: For interacting with the blockchain from the frontend.
Truffle: For compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
Ganache: Local blockchain environment for development and testing.
